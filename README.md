# Path Finding Algorithms Visualizer

This is a maze solver program that reads a maze from a file and creates the maze as a graph. The program then uses the graph to find the path from the start to the end of the maze specified in the input file. The following algorithms are used to solve the maze:

1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Random Search
5. A* Search

## How to run the program

You need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. The program can be run from the command line using the following command **along with the name of the test file**:

- `python3 main.py <test_file>`

  - e.g. `python3 main.py mazes/test.txt`
